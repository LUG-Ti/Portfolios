# Portfolios

Welcome to the **Portfolios Repository**, a collection of various unique portfolios, each showcasing creative designs and functional backends. This repository contains different portfolios from developers with distinct styles and technical approaches. Each folder represents a developer’s portfolio, containing both frontend and backend directories, along with details about the portfolio creator and their design inspiration.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
Portfolios/
│
└── [GitHub Username]/
    ├── frontend/
    ├── backend/
    └── README.md
```

- **frontend/**: This folder contains the frontend code for the portfolio, which includes the user interface, design elements, and client-side scripts.
- **backend/**: This folder includes the backend code, responsible for handling server-side logic, APIs, and database interactions.

Each portfolio folder also includes a `README.md` file with information about the developer and the portfolio's style.

## How to Navigate

- **README.md**: An introduction to the portfolio's creator, their design philosophy, and an overview of the tech stack used.
- **frontend/**: All the code related to the front-end design, frameworks used, and custom styling.
- **backend/**: The server-side logic, API endpoints, and database configurations.
